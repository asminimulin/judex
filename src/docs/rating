This is the description of how user rating system is working

Every problem has got its own cost at every moment. Starting cost for every problem is 1000 rating points. 
When user solves the problem on X (of 100) points, problem rating changes: if it was P rating points, it 
changes to NEW_P = P - int(X / 10) rating points. And user rating is increased by int((X / 100) * NEW_P).
